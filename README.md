# 👋 Hi, I'm Sambhav

I'm an **ex-founder** and **backend engineer** passionate about building distributed systems and intelligent agentic workflows. I enjoy designing and scaling AI-powered systems that bring real utility to users — from LLM-based retrieval to multi-step workflow automation.

## 🚀 What I’ve Been Building
Most recently, I founded **theved.ai**, where I built:

- 🔍 A **RAG system** using Qdrant, BERT embeddings, and locally hosted LLaMA3/Mistral models via Ollama.
- 🤖 An **agentic framework** powered by GPT-4-mini and OpenAI’s Agents SDK, integrating Gmail, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Slack using MCP for unified natural language workflows.
- 🖥 A **cross-platform app** (Swift + Electron) for voice transcription, feeding audio memory into the RAG system for persistent, searchable knowledge.

The UI offers:  
• Onboarding to connect user tools and grant API permissions.  
• A chat interface for cross-tool data retrieval and workflow execution.

## 🌐 Community
I also **host an open-source AI builders community**:

## 💡 What I'm Looking For
I'm looking to join a **fast-moving team** working on **AI agents, automation, or distributed infrastructure**, where I can apply my end-to-end experience and continue learning at scale.
