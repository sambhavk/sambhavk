# 👋 Hi, I'm Sambhav

I'm an **ex-founder** and **backend engineer** passionate about building distributed systems and intelligent agentic workflows. I enjoy designing and scaling AI-powered systems that bring real utility to users — from LLM-based retrieval to multi-step workflow automation.

## 🚀 What I’ve Been Building
Most recently, I founded **theved.ai**, where I built:

- 🔍 A **RAG system** using Qdrant, BERT embeddings, and locally hosted LLaMA3/Mistral models via Ollama.
- 🤖 An **agentic framework** powered by GPT-4-mini and OpenAI’s Agents SDK, integrating Gmail, Google Calendar, Tasks, and Slack using MCP for unified natural language workflows.
- 🖥 A **cross-platform app** (Swift + Electron) for voice transcription, feeding audio memory into the RAG system for persistent, searchable knowledge.

In ui, it offered 
  - An onboarding screen where user connects to their tools and grant Ved permissions to call tool APIs on user's behalf.
  - A chat interface from which user can request for cross tool data retrieval and workflow execution

## 🛠 Tech I Work With
- **Languages:** Python, Swift, SQL, Java
- **AI/ML Stack:** Transformers, Qdrant, Ollama, BERT, LLaMA3, Mistral, OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP
- **Backend:** FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kafka, Docker, REST/HTTP streaming, Spring boot & reactive
- **Tools:** Electron, Git, AWS, GCP, Redis

## 💡 What I'm Looking For
I'm looking to join a **fast-moving team** working on **AI agents, automation, or distributed infrastructure**, where I can apply my end-to-end experience and continue learning at scale.
